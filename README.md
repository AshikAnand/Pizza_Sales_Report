Introduction

In this project, we analyze pizza sales data to gain insights into ordering patterns, revenue generation, and customer preferences. The analysis is performed using SQL queries on a relational database containing orders, order details, and pizza information.

SQL Queries

The SQL queries in this project cover various aspects of pizza sales analysis, including:

Retrieving total orders placed
Calculating total revenue generated
Identifying the highest-priced pizza
Determining the most common pizza size ordered
Listing the top 5 most ordered pizza types
Analyzing the distribution of pizzas by category
Evaluating the hourly distribution of orders
Calculating the average number of pizzas ordered per day
Identifying the top revenue-generating pizza types
Assessing the percentage contribution of each pizza type to total revenue
Analyzing cumulative revenue over time
Determining the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue for each pizza category
Presentation
The presentation file provides a summary of the analysis findings and key insights derived from the SQL queries. It includes visualizations and explanations to communicate the results effectively.

Usage

To use the SQL queries, connect to a compatible relational database system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) and execute the queries provided in the queries.sql file.

To view the presentation, open the presentation.pptx file using a presentation software (e.g., Microsoft PowerPoint).
